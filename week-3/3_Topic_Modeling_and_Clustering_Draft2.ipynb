        "This week, we learn a second kind of document representation in clusters or topics. First, we take a text corpus that we have developed and discovery emergent clusters through a process known as clustering or partitioning. We pilot this here both with a well-known *flat* clustering method, `kmeans`, and also a *hierarchical* approach, `Ward's (minimum variance) method`. We will demonstrate a simple (graphical) approach to identifying optimal cluster number, the sillhouette method, and evaluate the quality of unsupervised clusters on labeled data. Next, we will explore a method of two dimensional content clustering called topic modeling (e.g., words cluster in topics; topics cluster in documents). This statistical technique models and computationally induces *topics* from data, which are sparse distributions over (nonexclusive clusters of) words, from which documents can formally be described as sparse mixtures. We will explore these topics and consider their utility for understanding trends within a corpus. We will consider how to construct models that take document cluster and topic loadings as predictive features, the basis of influence metrics and dynamically over time.\n",
