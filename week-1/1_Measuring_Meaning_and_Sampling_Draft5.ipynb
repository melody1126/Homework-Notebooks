This serves as a good starting place to track how the cultural attitude towards the liberal arts and its association with the vocational aspects of education. The inference I would like to make is that the liberal arts was more closely associated with vocational guidance and placement at the beginning – in the 1925 to 1935 period, undergraduate student advising at the University of Chicago contained academic, vocational, and therapeutic counseling. The University thought of the student as a whole person and provided advising in this manner. I hope to infer from the data that the public also considered liberal education closely related to the vocational, but there was an increasing division between the two."
